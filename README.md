<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p><i>My mission is to accelerate the transition to a healthier, more sustainable future for all. I am actively working on building my technical skills to realize this mission. Specifically, I recognize the huge opportunity with the intersection of technology and economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Whether this intersection is in energy with the optimization of the grid through renewable sourcing and batteries, transportation with effective public transit applications, or SAAS projects that provide real-time sustainability metrics, the possibilities are limitless.
