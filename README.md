<h2>Hi There! Welcome to my GitHub Profile.</h2>
<p>I am a 2020 graduate in sustainability from The Ohio State University. In January 2021, I completed the Full-Stack Software Engineering Program at FlatIron School where I learned Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & React.</p>
<p>Currently, I am a Software Engineer for Cycle Technology and a Web Developer for Schwing Marketing.</p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p><i>My mission is to accelerate the transition to a healthier, more sustainable future for all. I am actively working on building my technical skills to realize this mission. Specifically, I recognize the huge opportunity with the intersection of technology and economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Whether this intersection is in energy with the optimization of the grid through renewable sourcing and batteries, transportation with effective public transit applications, or SAAS projects that provide real-time sustainability metrics, the possibilities are limitless.
